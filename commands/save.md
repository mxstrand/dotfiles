description: Save investigation or changes to markdown file
---

Given what you've just done, please save your investigation or changes as a markdown file at $ARGUMENTS. If no path was given to you, save to cwd .claude-docs/tmp/YYYY-MM-DD-[brief-topic].md

For filename generation, prioritize: 1) logic/code changes (including tests), 2) config changes, 3) documentation updates. Use brief, descriptive topics (e.g., "auth-fix", "test-suite", "api-refactor").

Include key findings or changes with relevant file paths. This is important so that I can verify the findings you've made; there's no need to be verbose, I just need to see how you came to different conclusions.
