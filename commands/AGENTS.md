# Commands Directory

This directory contains custom Claude Code slash command definitions.

## Structure
- Each `.md` file becomes a `/commandname` command
- First line after frontmatter = description
- Full content = prompt that gets executed

Commands are auto-built and installed to `~/.claude/commands/` during setup.
