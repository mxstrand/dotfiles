The planning phase is complete and the user has approved the plan. Please save the agreed plan as a markdown file at .claude-docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-[brief-topic].md

The plan document should include:
- **Objective**: Brief summary of what we're implementing
- **Agreed Plan**: The specific steps/approach that was approved
- **Key Files**: Files that will be modified or created
- **Completion Criteria**: How we'll know the task is done

Keep it concise and actionable. This serves as a reference for what was agreed upon.
